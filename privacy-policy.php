      <h5>1.Collection of Information</h5> 
      <p>
        <strong> a)  We collect personally identifiable information when you voluntarily provide it to us. </strong><br>

We collect personally identifiable information from you in several different ways on the Site. Personally identifiable information means information that can be reasonably used to identify you personally, such as your name, LinkedIn URL, profile details, phone number and email address. We collect such information when you voluntarily provide it to use (for example when you complete an account registration using our online forms, or subscribe to one of our services). You can choose not to provide the requested information, but you might not be able to take advantage of certain Site features.<br>

 <strong>b)  We may automatically collect information about your browser or device, your use of the Site, and our browsing or search history when you interact with us.</strong><br>

When you access and use the Site, our technology and tools automatically collect and record certain non-personally identifiable information about your use of the Site (including your IP address, browser type, the make and model the device you used to access the Site, location information and other information relating to your use of the Site, browser or device).

We may also use cookies, pixels, web beacons, device of HTML5 local storage and caching, java script and other similar technologies to collect information about your use of and access to the Site, content or advertisements you view, and related to your activities on the Internet. Cookies are small bits of information that may be placed in your computer by web sites you visit, applications you use, or advertisements you view. Cookies alone tell us nothing about who you are, unless you or a third-party gives us personally identifiable information, which may then be linked to the data stored in the cookie. Pixels (or pixel tags, web beacons or clear GIFs) are small blocks of code placed on a web page or application that read and place cookies and transmit certain information, such as a browser or device’s IP address, when and how often the pixel was viewed, an identifier associated with the browser or device, or the type of browser being used.

Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these cross-platform or cross-device techniques, and those browser settings that block conventional cookies may have no effect on such techniques.<br>
 <strong>c)  Third-parties may also automatically collect information about you.</strong><br>

Some advertisements or embedded content on the Site may be served by third-party advertising companies or third-party content providers. Please note that these companies may also use cookies, pixels or other similar technologies to collect information about you, both on the Site and throughout the Internet. We do not have control over third-party information collection and use.<br>

 <strong>d)  We may build a profile about you based on information you voluntarily provide use, information we automatically collect from you, and information obtained from third-parties.</strong><br>

We may combine information provided by or collected from you in connection with your use of the Site with information provided by you to us in other ways, information we obtain from third-party market researchers, information provided to us via your use of social media platforms, public information, or other third-party information sources.<br>

 <strong>e)  Cross Tracking.</strong><br>

As noted above, we may use technologies or alternative techniques that obtain information about you, through your web-based activities (including your use of the site) across multiple devices. As noted above, please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these cross-platform or cross-device techniques, and those browser settings that block conventional cookies may have no effect on such techniques. As we discussed, we will use this information to provide targeted advertising services to you and, potentially, other services that are personalised and geared to you as further identified in this Policy.
